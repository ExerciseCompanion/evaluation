## Usability Goals and Senarios:

### User Goal 1

- **Scenario:** Your next task is to find the step history, pet health, and pet experience as quickly as possible.  Note the steps for today and yesterday.  Give a rough percentage approixmation of the pet's health and experience.
- **Success Condition:** User finds the step counter within a minute and denotes the correct step history.  Along with a percentage approximation within 10% for pet health and experience.

### User Goal 3
- **Task:** User can claim rewards and purchase any item
- **Scenario:** Assuming you've walked a few hundred steps, and wish to give your pet an accessory.  Find a way to gain currency in the tasks menu and find the shop menu to purchase an item.
